A flaw was found in the Linux kernel, where unauthorized access to the execution of the setuid file with capabilities was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s OverlayFS subsystem in how a user copies a capable file from a nosuid mount into another mount. This uid mapping bug allows a local user to escalate their privileges on the system.

Compile
```bash
make all
```
# Use

```bash
./fuse ./ovlcap/lower ./gc
```
In the second terminal enter

```
# Effect
